# food-practicing-js-project
This project was created during a JavaScript training course, where I created and integrated various parts of the website. I worked exclusively with JavaScript, while HTML and CSS were used as templates. In the 'js/modules' folder, I implemented:

tabs.js - tabs with descriptions of the offered menu items and illustrations.

slider.js - a slider with smooth scrolling and a page counter.

calc.js - a calculator for calculating the required calories per day, taking into account gender, age, and physical activity.

cards.js - cards with descriptions of menu items and prices, with data taken from the server.

timer.js - a timer counting down to the end of a promotion.

modal.js - a modal window for submitting personal information.

form.js - a form for submitting personal information to the server.

I assembled everything using webpack."
